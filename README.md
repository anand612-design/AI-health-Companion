# AI-health-Companion

AI Health Companion is a web-based platform aimed at helping users manage both their physical and mental health. This project leverages AI-driven features to offer personalized recommendations and holistic tools for well-being. Currently, the project is in its initial stages, with core features implemented, and future plans for AI integration and database support. 
Features (Partial Implementation)
Personalized Health Recommendations: AI-generated suggestions tailored to individual health needs for diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management
Mental Health Management: Tools like mindfulness activities, mood tracking, and motivational quotes designed to promote mental well-being.
Currently, these features are being mocked and will be extended in later stages.

Real-Time Updates and Reminders: Notifications to help users stay on track with their health goals and habits.
Future updates will allow for dynamic, personalized notifications.

User Authentication:
A basic secure login system with predefined user credentials (mocked).
The login system will be enhanced to use a database for authentication in future versions.

Interactive UI/UX:
The platform features a simple, visually appealing interface that allows seamless user navigation.
The user interface is designed for ease of use and will evolve in future updates.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
Backend: JavaScript (Vanilla for initial implementation; extensible to Node.js or Python frameworks like Flask/Django in the future)
Database: Not implemented in this version (currently mocked with hardcoded credentials)
